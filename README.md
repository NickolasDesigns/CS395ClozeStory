The packages you must install to run this code are the following: 
cython, pandas, neuralcoref, spacy, and tqdm.

You can install by running 'pip install ____' where ____ is replaced with the name of the package in the list. 

neuralcoref special note: 
      A bug as of Sunday, November 15th, 2020 has been discoverd by me on the neuralcoref download. You cannot just simply run 'pip install neuralcoref'. You must install the source code of neuralcoref through this link: https://github.com/huggingface/neuralcoref 
     
Run this code after you install the code from that link: 'python3 -m pip install .' 
      
NOTE: the dot '.' is supposed to be replaced by the path of the zip folder of the neuralcoref source code.
